         Note: llama2 sentencepiece has problems where in general
         encode(s1 + s2) != encode(s1) + encode(s2) due to whitespace handling.
         We can get around this by prepending s2 with a known token and slicing the
         beginning off the tokenized s2.

 Memory efficiency is important to us. All of our recipes are tested on a variety of setups including commodity GPUs with 24GB of VRAM as well as beefier options found in data centers.
 
-Single-GPU recipes expose a number of memory optimizations that aren't available in the distributed versions. These include support for low-precision optimizers from [bitsandbytes](https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/index) and fusing optimizer step with backward to reduce memory footprint from the gradients (see example [config](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/blob/main/recipes/configs/llama2/7B_full_low_memory.yaml)). For memory-constrained setups, we recommend using the single-device configs as a starting point. For example, our default QLoRA config has a peak memory usage of ``~9.3GB``. Similarly LoRA on single device with ``batch_size=2`` has a peak memory usage of ``~15.5GB``. Both of these are with ``dtype=bf16`` and ``AdamW`` as the optimizer.

+## Llama3
+
+torchtune supports fine-tuning for the Llama3 8B models with support for 70B on its way. We currently support LoRA, QLoRA and Full-finetune on a single GPU as well as LoRA and Full fine-tune on multiple devices. For all the details, take a look at our [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/torchtune/main/tutorials/llama3.html).
+
+
+In our initial experiments, QLoRA has a peak allocated memory of ``~9GB`` while LoRA on a single GPU has a peak allocated memory of ``~19GB``. To get started, you can use our default configs to kick off training.
+
+- LoRA on a single GPU.
+
+```bash
+tune run lora_finetune_single_device --config llama3/8B_lora_single_device
+```
+
+- QLoRA on a single GPU
+
+```bash
+tune run lora_finetune_single_device --config llama3/8B_qlora_single_device
+```
+
+- LoRA on 2 GPUs
+
+```bash
+tune run --nproc_per_node 4 lora_finetune_distributed --config llama3/8B_lora
+```
+
+- Full fine-tune on 2 GPUs
+
+```bash
