-## Overview
-
-This is a [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar for the formal specification language [TLA⁺](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B) and its embedded variant [PlusCal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlusCal).
-Tree-sitter is an incremental error-tolerant parser generator primarily aimed at language tooling such as highlighting, code folding, symbol finding, and other tasks making use of its fully-featured syntax tree query API.
-This grammar is intended to function gracefully while parsing a source file mid-edit, when the syntax isn't fully correct.
-It is also fast enough to re-parse the file on every keystroke.
-You can take the parser for a spin at https://tlaplus-community.github.io/tree-sitter-tlaplus/
-
-The most important files in this repo are `grammar.js` and `src/scanner.c`.
-The former is the source of truth for parser code generation and the latter contains logic for parsing the context-sensitive parts of TLA⁺ like nested proofs and conjunction/disjunction lists.
-This grammar is published as a [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/tree-sitter-tlaplus), [Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tlaplus/tree-sitter-tlaplus), and [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-tlaplus).
-You can see examples of how to consume these packages [here](test/consumers).
-A WASM build is also included in the Node.js package and attached to the releases in this repo.
-
-A blog post detailing the development process of this parser can be found [here](https://ahelwer.ca/post/2023-01-11-tree-sitter-tlaplus/).
-This repo is [mirrored on sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~ahelwer/tree-sitter-tlaplus).
-
-## Aims & Capabilities
-
-The aim of this project is to facilitate creation of modern user-assistive language tooling for TLA⁺.
-To that end, the project provides two main capabilities:
-1. Provide an approximately-correct parse tree for TLA⁺ specifications in standardized form, for easy integration with general projects designed to consume the tree-sitter grammars of many languages.
-1. Provide a [tree query API](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#pattern-matching-with-queries) for efficiently querying the TLA⁺ parse tree, in addition to an API for arbitrary programmatic exploration of same, with bindings in multiple languages for easy integration with projects specifically targeting TLA⁺.
-
-The correctness criterion of this parser is as follows: if the TLA⁺ specification being parsed constitutes valid TLA⁺ (both syntactically and semantically), the parse tree will be correct.
-If the spec is not valid TLA⁺, the parse tree will be approximately correct - perhaps permissively allowing illegal syntax, or interpreting erroneous syntax in strange ways.
-This permissive behavior makes it excellent for user-assistive language tooling, but a less-compelling choice as the backbone for an interpreter or model-checker.
-Application possibilities include:
- * Advanced syntax highlighting
- * Syntax-aware code folding
- * Lightweight backend for a TLA⁺ [language server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
- * Writing TLA⁺ specs via dictation using [Cursorless](https://github.com/pokey/cursorless-vscode)
- * Semantic analysis of TLA⁺ specs [on GitHub](https://github.com/github/semantic)
- * Translation of TLA⁺ operator symbols [into their unicode equivalents](https://github.com/tlaplus-community/tlauc)
-
-## Use & Notable Integrations
-
-There are a number of avenues available for consuming & using the parser in a project of your own; see examples in several different programming languages [here](test/consumers).
-
-Notable projects currently using or integrating this grammar include:
- * [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) for TLA⁺ syntax highlighting & code folding in Neovim
- * [tla-web](https://github.com/will62794/tla-web) for a web-based TLA⁺ interpreter and trace explorer
- * GitHub for syntax highlighting of TLA⁺ files and snippets
- * [tlauc](https://github.com/tlaplus-community/tlauc) for translating between ASCII and Unicode TLA⁺ symbols
-
-As applicable, query files for integrations live in the `integrations` directory.
-
-## Build & Test
-
-Be sure to clone the repo with the `--recurse-submodules` parameter, or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` if you already cloned it without that parameter.
-
-If using nix:
-1. Run `nix-shell`
-1. Run `tree-sitter test`
-
-Otherwise:
-1. Install [node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
-1. Ensure a C compiler is installed and on your path
-1. Run `npm install`
-1. Run `npm test`
-
-### Corpus Tests
-
-This test ensures the grammar can parse all modules in the [tlaplus/examples](https://github.com/tlaplus/examples) repo, which is included as a git submodule.
-To run:
-1. If this is the first time running tree-sitter on your machine, run `npx tree-sitter init-config`
-1. For Unix-type OSs, run `./test/run-corpus.sh`; for Windows, run `.\test\run-corpus.ps1`
-1. The scripts exit with error code 0 if successful
-
-### Build WASM & Start Playground
-
-If using nix:
-1. Run `nix-shell`
-1. Run `tree-sitter build-wasm`
-1. Start the playground with `tree-sitter playground`
-
-Otherwise:
-1. Install [node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
-1. Install [Emscripten 3.x](https://emscripten.org/)
-1. Run `npm install`
-1. Run `npx tree-sitter build-wasm`
-1. Start the playground with `npx tree-sitter playground`
-
-The playground enables you to easily try out the parser in your browser.
-You can use the playground [online](https://tlaplus-community.github.io/tree-sitter-tlaplus/) (serving the latest release) or run it locally by following the directions above.
-
-The playground consists of a pane containing an editable TLA⁺ spec, and another pane containing the parse tree for that spec.
-The parse tree is updated in real time as you edit the TLA⁺ spec.
-You can click parse tree nodes to highlight the corresponding snippet of TLA⁺, and move the cursor around the spec to show the corresponding parse tree node.
-You can click the "log" checkbox and open your browser's development console to see the parser's debug output as it attempts to parse the TLA⁺ spec.
-You can also click the "query" checkbox to open a third pane for testing [tree queries](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#pattern-matching-with-queries); for example, enter the following to match all operator names in a capture named `@operator` (indicated by the names becoming highlighted):
-```
-(operator_definition name: (identifier) @operator)
-```
-
-## Fuzzing
-
-You can fuzz the grammar if you're running Linux with a recent version of Clang installed.
-Do so as follows:
-1. Clone the repo with the `--recurse-submodules` parameter
-2. From repo root, run the bash script `test/fuzzing/build-for-fuzzing.sh`
-3. From repo root, run `test/fuzzing/out/tree_sitter_tlaplus_fuzzer`
-
-## Contributions
-
-One easy way to contribute is to add your TLA⁺ specifications to the [tlaplus/examples](https://github.com/tlaplus/examples) repo, which this grammar uses as a valuable test corpus!
-
-Pull requests are welcome. If you modify `grammar.js`, make sure you run `npx tree-sitter generate` before committing & pushing.
-Generated files are (unfortunately) currently present in the repo but will hopefully be removed in [the future](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/discussions/1243).
-Their correspondence is enforced during CI.
